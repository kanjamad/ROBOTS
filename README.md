# ROBOT
Buid A CSS Robot
The robot will have laser eyes.
Make a simple ahapes with HTML and CSS


1. Shapes and Flow

<div> element as a container: somtimes it held images, text and help both.
divs are by default, invisible rectangles.
To make an empty <div> visible , three things have to happen:
(1) a width
(2)a hight
(3) either a background or a border color.
I'm not going to put anything in there <div> be cause I'll use them to build a robot!
Every shape in this robot is a shape that can create with nothing but a little bit of HTML and CSS.

This robot is made of 60 lines of CSS and about 25 lines of HTML.
* Use JavaScript to activate the tricking laserbeams in its head.

2. Inventing the Wheel
According to the default, normal flow of the web everything put on a web page wants to sit flush on top of each other.
start
.foot class  will building a circle.
border control
Can make tons of different shapes with just 2 CSS properties
border-radius which played with and combination punch of border-left, border-right, border-top and border-bottom.
Can style the borders of any HTML element one by one to make trianfles, starsm trapezoids and more 
div{
    border-left: width style color;
    border-top: width style color;
    etc...
}

3. Brains!
It's time to make robot head visible.
This should be familiar : Just made the head visible by giving it color, height, and width 
add a border radius. And  style more add border-bottom property giving only one side of shape a contrasting border.


4. Laser eyes
Used a radial gradient to glowy laser eyes.
By default a round gradient wants to be centered in the HTML element that cintains it. Will use that, and also use background-size to colorl how many times and where it appears in the shape.

5. An antenna
I am going to call it antenna though. Class name beep
The CSS for the antenna is similar to the CSS for the torso shape. An extra border gives it that hourglass shape.
First, just going to flesh out thr basics of the antenna's size, style and color.
Adding a transparent left and right border will give the antenna a trapezoid shape like the torso.
But when I add a top border, something pretty neat happens!
