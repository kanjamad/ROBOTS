# ROBOT
Buid A CSS Robot
The robot will have laser eyes.
Make a simple ahapes with HTML and CSS


1. Shapes and Flow

<div> element as a container: somtimes it held images, text and help both.
divs are by default, invisible rectangles.
To make an empty <div> visible , three things have to happen:
(1) a width
(2)a hight
(3) either a background or a border color.
I'm not going to put anything in there <div> be cause I'll use them to build a robot!
Every shape in this robot is a shape that can create with nothing but a little bit of HTML and CSS.

This robot is made of 60 lines of CSS and about 25 lines of HTML.
* Use JavaScript to activate the tricking laserbeams in its head.

2. Inventing the Wheel
According to the default, normal flow of the web everything put on a web page wants to sit flush on top of each other.
start
.foot class  will building a circle.
border control
Can make tons of different shapes with just 2 CSS properties
border-radius which played with and combination punch of border-left, border-right, border-top and border-bottom.
Can style the borders of any HTML element one by one to make trianfles, starsm trapezoids and more 
div{
    border-left: width style color;
    border-top: width style color;
    etc...
}

3. Brains!
It's time to make robot head visible.
This should be familiar : Just made the head visible by giving it color, height, and width 
add a border radius. And  style more add border-bottom property giving only one side of shape a contrasting border.


4. Laser eyes
Used a radial gradient to glowy laser eyes.
By default a round gradient wants to be centered in the HTML element that cintains it. Will use that, and also use background-size to colorl how many times and where it appears in the shape.

5. An antenna
